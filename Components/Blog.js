                <h2>About ONJA</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm studying at ONJA school, which is a NGO lead by SAM and located in Mahanoro. We are twenty students at ONJA, to learn english and coding with seven staff. This organisation is based on supporting the students who can't go to university but still want to study. We studyed english last year up to now, but this year we focus more on coding.

                <h2>At the beginning of my study</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally, I really love studying, because I want to learn many things. As far as I'm concerned, study assists me to have a better life in the future as many students want. That's what I'm doing now. However, at the beginning, I found it really hard to get started of my study at onja and to get use to it, but in fact working hard pushed me to get over that. That's why, I admit that nothing is easy on earth without trying hard. Apart from that, I had to change many things in my life, including the way of studying. Moreover, I needed to dicsipline myself and set up a new method of managing time so that I can use my time wisely.

                <p>
                    At this time, my study is getting better. Thanks to all sophisticated staff at ONJA, because without them I would never be on this stage now.
